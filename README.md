This project aims to use Python generators for streaming data of the Wold bank. It's about writing user-defined functions, iterators, list comprehensions and generators to wrangle and extract meaningful information from a real-world dataset.

_Data on world economies for over half a century

_Indicators:
*Population
*Electricity consumption
*CO2 emissions
*Literacy rates
*Unemployment
*Mortality rates

Generators for the large data limit:
*Use a generator to load a file line by line
*Works on streaming data
*Read and process the file until all lines are exhausted

feature_names and row_vals contain the header names of the dataset and actual values of a row from the dataset, respectively.
